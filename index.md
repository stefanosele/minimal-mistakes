Welcome!
========

I'm a senior machine learning researcher at [PROWLER.io](www.prowler.io). I got my PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) focusing on Gaussian process models for facial behaviour analysis.

My current research interests are in statistical machine learning, and, in particular, probabilistic models with applications to autonomous decision making and model-based reinforcement learning.
