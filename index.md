# Welcome!

I'm an applied scientist at [PROWLER.io](www.prowler.io), where I specialise on probablistic models for time series analysis and forecasting. I received my PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing). I actively do research around Gaussian processes (GPs) with particular focus on fast and efficient approximate inference. I am also interested in state-space models, stochastic variance estimation (heteroscedasticity) and optimising GPs with natural gradients.

A byproduct of my research is the creation of an internal library for linear time inference in GPs for time series and, a model-based reinforcement learning investement strategy that runs on a fund.

I'm a senior machine learning researcher at [PROWLER.io](www.prowler.io). I got my PhD in Computing from [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing) focusing on Gaussian process models for facial behaviour analysis.
My current research interests are in statistical machine learning, and, in particular, probabilistic models with applications to autonomous decision making and model-based reinforcement learning.
