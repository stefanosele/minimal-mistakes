As of December 2016, I work for PROWLER.io. I'm one of the early members and joined the company from the very beginning.

Previously I was a research assistant at Imperial College London where I got my PhD in Computing at the [intelligent behaviour understanding group (iBUG)](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Maja Pantic](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/maja/).

Before that I studied in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki where I received my Diploma in Electrical and Computing Engineering and closely colaborated with my mentor and advisor [Prof. Leontios Hadjileontiadis](http://psyche.ee.auth.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18%3A2010-10-25-16-52-20&catid=4%3Aproffesors&Itemid=10&lang=en).

Between my undergrad and doctoral studies I worked as a research assistant at the [signal processing and biomedical technology unit lab](http://psyche.ee.auth.gr/) and took part in Microsoft's Imagine Cup software developement competition with my colleagues
[Stamatis Georgoulis](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~sgeorgou/) [Dimitris Tzionas](https://www.dimtzionas.com/) and Kostas Vrennas. We received the 1st national award and participated in the world finals with our project *Epione*.
